# Covid-19-Health-Check

As part of this project, a Machine Learning Model was created to forecast COVID-19 outcomes based on inputs such as cough, shortness of breath, fever, headache, and sore throat. To integrate this functionality, a web application was conceptualized and built using Django, with COVID-19 results communicated via SMS.
